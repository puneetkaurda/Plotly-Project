# Plotly-Project
## Objective:
To deploy a dashboard via my GitHub Page of my Biodiversity data visualization.
In this project, I used Javascript's Plotly library to create three basic plots: 
 -horizontal bar chart, 
- gauge chart
- bubble chart

Used D3.json to fetch external data and Javascript functional programming to manipulate the data. I added event handlers to add interactivity to this data visualization. Charts are built once a user selects a sample ID number from the drop-down menu options. Finally, I deployed this interactive chart via GitHub Pages.

# Plotly-Project
## Objective:
To deploy a dashboard via my GitHub Page of my Biodiversity data visualization: https://puneetkaurda.github.io/Plotly-Project/

In this project, I used Javascript's Plotly library to create three basic plots: 

- horizontal bar chart
- gauge chart
- bubble chart

Used D3.json to get external data and Javascript functional programming to manipulate the data. I added event handlers to add interactivity to this data visualization. Charts are built once a user selects a sample ID number from the drop-down menu options. Finally, I deployed this interactive chart via GitHub Pages.
